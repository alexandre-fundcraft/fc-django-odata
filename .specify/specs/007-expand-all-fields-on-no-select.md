# SPECKIT-007: Expand All Fields for Related Entities When No $select is Specified

## 1. Objective

The objective of this specification is to modify the OData `$expand` functionality such that when a related entity is expanded without an explicit `$select` clause, all fields of that related entity are serialized and returned in the response.

## 2. Background

Currently, when an OData query includes an `$expand` clause for a navigation property, but does not specify which fields to `$select` from the expanded entity, the system may return only a subset of fields (e.g., just the ID) or behave inconsistently. This deviates from the expected OData behavior, where omitting `$select` implies selecting all available fields. This inconsistency can lead to incomplete data being returned for expanded entities, requiring additional queries or client-side workarounds.

## 3. Requirements

-   When a URL contains an `$expand` clause (e.g., `.../Posts?$expand=Author`) and the expanded entity (e.g., `Author`) does *not* have an accompanying `$select` clause (e.g., `.../Posts?$expand=Author($select=name)`), the serializer for the expanded entity must include all its fields.
-   This behavior must apply to all levels of `$expand` (e.g., `$expand=Author,Comments`, `$expand=Author($expand=User)`).
-   The change should be implemented in `django_odata/serializers.py` or `django_odata/viewsets.py`, specifically within the logic that processes `$expand` and `$select` query options.
-   Existing `$select` behavior (where specified fields are returned) must remain unchanged.
-   Unit tests must be added to verify this new behavior.

## 4. Scope

This specification primarily impacts the OData serialization logic in `django_odata/serializers.py` and potentially the query parsing in `django_odata/viewsets.py`. Changes will involve:

-   Identifying the point where `$expand` is processed.
-   Modifying the serialization context or logic to ensure all fields are included when `$select` is absent for an expanded navigation property.
-   Adding new test cases to `tests/test_serializers.py` or `tests/test_viewsets.py` to cover this specific scenario.
