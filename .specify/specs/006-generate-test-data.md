# SPECKIT-006: Generate Fake Data for OData API Testing

## 1. Objective

The goal of this specification is to create a Django management command that populates the database with realistic fake data for the blog application. This data will be used for manual and automated testing of the OData APIs, ensuring that the API endpoints behave as expected with a populated database.

## 2. Background

To effectively test the OData API, we need a consistent and reproducible set of test data. Manually creating this data is time-consuming and error-prone. A dedicated management command will allow developers to quickly seed their local databases with a rich set of data, facilitating the development and testing of OData features like filtering, ordering, and expanding.

We will use the `Faker` library to generate realistic data for model fields such as names, text, and dates.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Create a Management Command

-   A new management command named `seed_data` must be created within the `blog` application.
-   The command should be executable via `python manage.py seed_data`.
-   The command should clear all existing data from the relevant tables before seeding to ensure a clean state.

### 3.2. Data Generation

The command should generate the following data:

-   **Users/Authors**:
    -   10 `User` objects.
    -   10 `Author` objects, each linked to a `User`.
-   **Categories**:
    -   15 `Category` objects with unique names.
-   **Tags**:
    -   30 `Tag` objects with unique names.
-   **Blog Posts**:
    -   100 `BlogPost` objects with realistic titles, content, and slugs.
    -   Each post must be assigned a random author.
    -   Each post should have between 1 and 4 random categories and tags.
-   **Comments**:
    -   300 `Comment` objects.
    -   Each comment must be associated with a random blog post.

### 3.3. Dependencies

-   The `Faker` library must be added as a development dependency.

## 4. Scope

This specification covers the following:

-   Creation of a new management command: `example/blog/management/commands/seed_data.py`.
-   Modification of `pyproject.toml` and `requirements-dev.txt` to add `Faker` as a dependency.
-   The command will target the models defined in `example/blog/models.py`.
