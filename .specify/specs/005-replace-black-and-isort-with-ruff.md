# SPECKIT-005: Replace Black and Isort with Ruff

## 1. Objective

The goal of this specification is to replace the current code formatting and linting tools, `black` and `isort`, with a single, more performant tool: `ruff`. This change aims to simplify the development workflow, reduce the number of dependencies, and improve the speed of code quality checks.

## 2. Background

Currently, the project uses `black` for code formatting and `isort` for import sorting. While these tools have served us well, `ruff` has emerged as a popular alternative that combines the functionality of multiple tools (including `flake8`, `black`, and `isort`) into a single, extremely fast binary written in Rust.

By migrating to `ruff`, we can:
-   **Simplify our toolchain**: Replace multiple dependencies with a single one.
-   **Improve performance**: `ruff` is significantly faster than the combination of Python-based tools.
-   **Maintain consistency**: `ruff` can be configured to enforce the same style as `black` and `isort`.

## 3. Requirements

The migration to `ruff` must satisfy the following requirements:

-   All existing `black` and `isort` configurations must be removed from the project.
-   `ruff` must be added as a development dependency.
-   `ruff` must be configured to format code and sort imports according to our current style guidelines.
-   The `Makefile` must be updated to use `ruff` for the `lint` and `format` commands.
-   The development environment must be updated to reflect these changes.

## 4. Scope

This specification covers the following files and configurations:

-   `pyproject.toml`: For managing dependencies and tool configurations.
-   `requirements-dev.txt`: For development dependencies.
-   `Makefile`: For development commands.

Any other files that reference `black` or `isort` should also be updated.
