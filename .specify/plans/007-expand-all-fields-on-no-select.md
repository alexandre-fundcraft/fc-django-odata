# Plan: Expand All Fields for Related Entities When No $select is Specified

This plan outlines the steps to implement **SPECKIT-007**, which involves modifying the OData `$expand` functionality to serialize all fields of an expanded entity when no `$select` clause is explicitly provided.

## 1. Analyze Existing OData Serialization Logic

-   Examine `django_odata/serializers.py` to understand how `$expand` and `$select` are currently handled during serialization.
-   Identify the classes and methods responsible for determining which fields of a related entity are included in the response.
-   Review `django_odata/viewsets.py` to see how query options (`$expand`, `$select`) are parsed and passed to the serializer.

## 2. Identify Modification Points

-   Pinpoint the exact location where the serialization context for expanded entities is built.
-   Determine where the absence of a `$select` clause for an expanded entity can be detected.

## 3. Implement the Change

-   Modify the serialization logic (likely in `django_odata/serializers.py`) to, if an expanded navigation property does not have an associated `$select` clause, explicitly instruct the serializer to include all fields of that related entity. This might involve:
    -   Adjusting the `get_fields` method of the OData serializer.
    -   Modifying the context passed to nested serializers.

## 4. Add Unit Tests

-   Create new test cases in `tests/test_serializers.py` or a new test file if appropriate.
-   These tests should cover scenarios where:
    -   A navigation property is expanded without `$select` (expect all fields).
    -   A navigation property is expanded with `$select` (expect only selected fields).
    -   Multiple levels of `$expand` are used, with and without `$select` at each level.

## 5. Verify and Validate

-   Manually test the OData API endpoints with `$expand` queries, ensuring the new behavior is correctly applied.

## 6. Create a TODO list

-   Create a `TODO.md` file to track the implementation of this plan.

I will now ask for your approval before proceeding with the implementation.
